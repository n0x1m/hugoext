# hugo v0.49.2

The few files in this directory are copied from the [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) repository at tag
[hugo@v0.49.2](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/tree/v0.49.2/) and only slightly modified.
It's the easiest way to get working what I needed to work as the few required functions are well
isolated. I've added Hugo's Apache License v2.0.
